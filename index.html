  <h3 class="flashy"> What is the difference between a muffin and a cupcake? </h3>
  <p>
    The mixing process and the consistency of the batter differentiates cupcakes and muffins. <br />
    Cupcakes are made by creaming the butter and sugar together to create a smooth, fluffy batter. <br />
    ... Muffin batter, on the other hand, is beaten briefly and remains relatively lumpy. <br />
    This makes for a more dense baked good.
